BeanQuest : Machine Learning for Dry Bean Analysis


The Dry Bean Dataset is a widely used rocking dataset in the field of agricultural research and product classification. In this thesis, we explore the application of various machine learning techniques to classify dried bean varieties according to their morphological characteristics. The aim of this research is to develop accurate and efficient classification models that will help identify and classify dried bean species, and contribute to improving crop management and agricultural practices.

We begin by performing an exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the characteristics of the dataset, including feature distributions, correlations, and class imbalances. Next, we preprocess the dataset by addressing missing values, normalizing features, and balancing class distributions to ensure a fair representation of each type of bean.

We evaluate various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, to classify dried bean varieties. We conduct extensive experiments to compare the performance of these algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. Experimental results show that the random forest algorithm outperforms other models in the dry bean classification task, achieving an accuracy of over 90%. We delve deeper into the performance of the model by analyzing the significance of the feature and exploring the decision limits to gain insights into the distinctive features for the dry bean classification.
